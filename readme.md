## About The Project

**BeavFlatten** is a powerful, client-side web tool designed to instantly flatten complex directory structures within ZIP archives. Have you ever downloaded a project from GitHub and found yourself digging through endless nested folders? BeavFlatten solves this by extracting all files, moving them to a single top-level directory, and intelligently renaming them based on their original path.

It's fast, secure, and incredibly easy to use.

### Built With

*   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)**
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For a modern, responsive UI.
*   **JSZip.js**: For client-side ZIP processing.
*   **FileSaver.js**: For enabling file downloads in the browser.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Purely Client-Side**: No file uploads. Your data stays 100% private and secure in your browser.
üóÇÔ∏è **Directory Flattening**: Intelligently converts `path/to/your/file.txt` into `path--to--your--file.txt`.
üß† **Smart Exclusion**: Automatically ignores common junk like `.git` folders and `.DS_Store` files.
üîß **Configurable Exceptions**: You have full control to specify files or folders that should *not* be excluded.
üåç **Multi-language Support**: Full UI support for English, Simplified Chinese (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá), and Traditional Chinese (ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá).
üöÄ **Two Versions, One Goal**: Explore two different UX approaches with the **DeepSeek** and **GeminiPro** versions.
